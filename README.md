# Unity 2D Maze Generator and Solver

**Welcome to the Unity 2D Maze Generator project!** This Unity project is designed to generate 2D mazes using both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Backtracking algorithms. Additionally, an agent is implemented to navigate and solve the generated mazes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed (optional)

### Running the Project in Unity Editor
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unity-2d-maze-generator.git
    ```
2. Open Unity Hub.
3. Add the downloaded project folder to Unity Hub.
4. Open the project in Unity Editor.
5. Explore the Maze Generator scene.

### Running the Simulation(On Linux)
1. Download the [Build folder](/builds).
2. Run the executable file named "build1.x86_64".
3. Explore the maze-solving simulation.

## Features
- **Maze Generation:** Utilizes DFS and Backtracking algorithms to create intriguing 2D mazes.
- **Maze Solving:** An agent is implemented to solve the generated mazes.
- **Simulation:** Experience the maze-solving process in the standalone build.
